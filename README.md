# Text-Summarizer

Summarization is the task of reducing the size of the initial text while at the same time preserving key informational elements and the meaning of content.
It is very challenging, because when we as humans summarize a piece of text, we usually read it entirely to develop our understanding, and then write a summary highlighting its main points. Since computers lack human knowledge and language capability, it makes automatic text summarization a very difficult and non-trivial task.
